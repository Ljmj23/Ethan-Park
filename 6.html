                   <p class="ex2"> This work represents a scene where I recall my past childhood and can't come back. I used six different clothes and expressed the process of slowly growing using clothes of different sizes. There are various pieces of clothing coming out of some of the clothes as they slowly float upwards in the shape of a whirlwind to express the inevitable disappearance of happiness but also can't return to old memories. To make the pieces of clothing into various shapes, the woodwork was hardened and attached to the wire to form. Then, I attached the perforated clothes to a wide wire plate and hung the pieces on the wall to express the pieces escaping from the fixed and drilled holes to show them rising upward.Â </p>
