                   <p class="ex2"> I tried to show the three different situations in the past, present, and future from the old reservoir near my house to show how fast technology developed these days. Currently, as technology develops I try to represent this situation with the road views, navigation, internet, etc which we can use normally. In the future, I was inspired by the virtual reality world which we canâ€™t really go to, and trend to represent this through creating distorted images of parts of places that will be redeveloped and changed in the future. Lastly, I also added some yellow ribbons which contain the articles of this place from 3 different perspectives: the past, present, and future. </p>
