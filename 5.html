                   <p class="ex2"> This work introduces my favorite Chandler book, The Big Sleep, in a newspaper format. The Big Sleep is a 1900s mystery novel that was impressed by the relationship of complex characters and the social corruption caused by the Great Depression at the time. It is a mixture of novels and newspaper articles published in the early 1900s. What I wrote in the newspaper was a quote and explanation of social corruption from each character, and I added a description of the seriousness of the Great Depression in the newspapers that came out in the early 1900s. The sudden appearance of protest pickets and decaying textures emphasize the social evils of the time verbally and visually. Besides, photos of characters placed here and there were connected in thin lines to express complicated relationships and write a brief description of the relationship in them.
