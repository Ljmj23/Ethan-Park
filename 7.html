                   <p class="ex2"> Mix media </p>
                   <p class="ex2"> This is a poster that introduces Penny Board which has different sizes, materials, wheels, boards, and so on from normal skateboards. I thought it would be interesting to introduce the Penny Board because most people don't know that such a completely different board exists. Also, I drew the front and back of the penny board in real size so I can convey the feeling of being on the penny board if it is attached to the floor. In the remaining space, IÂ  wrote down the materials, price, size, advantage, and other functions. I felt it was better to make it as rough as possible so I included the feeling of street art in my drawing and font. Next, the poster is printed with the most visible colors green, blue, and red to attract the people in the skateboard park as I attach my posters.
