                   <p class="ex2"> It was interesting to see that water was found on the moon after reading this article, but this artwork contains my question about whether something other than water on the moon could have been found in the world's best space science organization. NASA found water on the moon as an airship with a heat detector machine called SOPHIA. In this work, I was inspired by the shape of mysterious creatures that we can recognize only through the microscope glass and added images that show the heat detection. Also, to express that the universe is a mysterious space that I don't know, I added a questionable sentence that can only be recognized by folding it in a certain way.  </p>
