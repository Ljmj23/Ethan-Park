                   <p class="ex2">This artwork is inspired by an artist named Gordon-Matta Clark. His artwork is usually created through buildings or objects that we can see in common but he made it look very unique and interesting by cutting down the pieces and visualizing them in different ways. So, I decided to make an artwork that interestingly introduces the Macbook since itâ€™s one of the objects that most people use. I attached the acrylic plates in accordion format and cut them out in various shapes by laser cutting. I printed out the MacBook's internal photos and detailed information and attached them to the front and back of the acrylic plate. I wanted to show the inside part of the MacBook in a completely different way from the original MacBook by using photos that are magnified.</p>
