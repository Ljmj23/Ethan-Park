                   <p class="ex2"> It was interesting that an unexpected resource was found from the dry surfaces like deserts which are full of sand and stones. So in this artwork, I tried to represent the water supply from the unexpected substances and also made it to use in a practical way. To create the water, I used stones, dry leaves, sand which the water was created through condensation from these substances, and made the water  lters with charcoal, gravel, sand, and stones. After the water is created and  ltered, it will transfer through the hose and supply the water to the plants.</p>
